1∼N integers，we can divide the numbers into 2 sets and the sum of each set are the same.

For example，N=3，we can divide {1,2,3} into {1,2} and {3}.

For N=7，there are 4 subsets:
{1,6,7} and {2,3,4,5}
{2,5,7} and {1,3,4,6}
{3,4,7} and {1,2,5,6}
{1,2,4,7} and {3,5,6}
Given N，Please print out the number of ways that can put in the same sum sets.
