Given two ascending array A and B, a target number x.
print out (i, j) when A[i]+B[j]=x

Input:
n, m, x (n is length of A, m is length of B, x is the target value)
n integers for A array
m integers for B array

Output
i j (index of A and B that makes A[i] + B[j] = x)

Sample Input:
4 5 6
1 2 4 7
3 4 6 8 9

Sample output:
1 1
