Arithmetic sequence a+nb, n=0,1,2,3...
a is non-negative integer, b is positive integer. ( a can be 0, but b will not be 0)

In a set S with double squares, find all arithmetic sequence with b as n.

double square means the number has properties as p^2+q^2 (p and q are non-negative integers）。

Input
n
m, the upper bound of p and q

Output:
No such sequence then output “NONE”, else output several lines
a b

The number in sequence are less than 10000.

Constraints:
3≤n≤25,
1≤m≤250,
0≤p,q≤m

Input:
5
7

Output:
1 4
37 4
2 8
29 8
1 12
5 12
13 12
17 12
5 20
2 24
