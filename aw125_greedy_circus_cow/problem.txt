Farmer John has N cows(1..N), they plan to join the circus.
They are practising the skill to stack as a tower, each cow has its own weight Wi and Strength Si.
If one cow can't support all the weight(not include himself) on him minus his strength, that value call risk value.
The bigger the risk value, the possibility of the cow crash is higher.
Find out how to arrange the cows to make the risk sum the smallest.
