Rome:   I	V	X	L	C	D	M
Number:	1	5	10	50	100	500	1000
I,X,C,M can be combined, but you can not have more than 3 letters.

For example, III is 3，CCC is 300。

V,L,D can not be together

Usually the letter can be combined as sum like below
For example，CCLXVIII = 100 + 100 + 50 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 268。

Or，IV = 4，IX = 9，XL = 40。

For 39，IXL is wrong； XXXIX is correct.

490: CDXC，not XD；99: XCIX，not IC；990: CMXC，not XM.

90:XC，not LXL.
