An one way graph has n nodes and m edges. the node number from 1 ~ n, the graph might have circle. and the edge can have negative weight
Printout shortest distance from 1 to n, the maximum edges can use is k. If can't find, print impossible

This is to optimize the bellman_ford approach, very common to be used for getting shortest path
