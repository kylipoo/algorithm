There are N hills, each hill's height is an integer.

To avoid tax, the difference of highest and lowest of the hills can't be over 17.
To reduce x height of a hill, cost x^2 money.
Each hill can only change once and the height changes has to be integer.

What is the minimum cost.

Input:
N
Height of the hills

Output
minimal money

constraints:
1≤N≤1000,
each height 0∼100

Sample input:
5
20
4
1
24
21
Sample output:
18
Explain
Increase hill with height 1 with 3 units，Height 24 reduce 3 units
