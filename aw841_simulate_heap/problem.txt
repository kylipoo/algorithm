Write a heap simulator for below operations:
1. I x, insert a number x;
2. PM, input the smallest number;
3. DM, delete the smallest number in the heap.
4. D k, delete kth inserted number.
5. C k x, update kth number, make it x;

After N operations, for any number 2 operation, output the smallest number.

Input
N (how many lines below)
One of the 5 operations like I x, PM, DM, D k, C k x

Output
printout every PM, which is the smallest number

Range
1<=N<=10^5
-10^9 <=x<=10^9

Sample Input
8
I -10
PM
I -10
D 1
C 2 8
I 6
PM
DM

Sample output
-10
6
