In a garden, Dave picked all the fruits and put them in different groups by type.
Then Dave decided to merge all of them into one group.
Every merge takes some effort, the effort needed is equal to the sum of the fruit weights of the two groups.
After n-1 merge, there will be one group.
Dave's effort number equals to the sum of all the merge effort.
Given each fruit weight is 1, given fruit numbers and types, find a way to make Dave use least effort to merge

For example there are 3 fruits: 1，2，9
Dave can merge 1 and 2 in to group 3, effort will be 3
Then the new group 3 merge with group 9 the total effort will be 12.
Total effort: 3+12=15。
15 is the smallest effort value

constraints:
1≤n≤10000,
1≤ai≤20000

Sample input:
3 
1 2 9 
Sample output:
15
