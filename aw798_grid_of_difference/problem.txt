Given an 2D grid n x m
with q operations, each operation contains x1, y1, x2, y2, c,
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) means the upper left corner and bottom right corner.
each operation will add c to the element
print out the new grid

Input
n, m, q
grid
x1, y1, x2, y2, c

output
final grid

Range
1<=n, m <=100000,
1<=q<=100000,
1<=x1<=x2<=n
1<=y1<=y2<=m
-1000 <=c <=1000
-1000 <= element <=1000
