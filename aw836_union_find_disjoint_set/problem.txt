Given n numbers, 1~n, at first each number belongs to its own set.

Now we will do m operations:
1 M a b, union a set and b set, if they are already in the same set, do nothing.
2 Q a b, find out if a and b are in the same set.

Range
1≤n,m≤10^5

Sample input:
4 5
M 1 2
M 3 4
Q 1 2
Q 1 3
Q 3 4

Sample output:
