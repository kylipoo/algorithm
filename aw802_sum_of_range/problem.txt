There is a very long array along the x-axis, the value on each position is 0.
Now we will do n operations, each operation will add c on one of the positions
Then we will do m queries. each query contains l and r, you need to find out the sum if [l, r]
Input
n, m (n is lines for add ops, m is lines for queries)
n lines each with x and c
m lines each with l and r
Output
m lines with the sum

Range
−10^9≤x≤10^9,
1≤n,m≤10^5,
−10^9≤l≤r≤10^9,
−10000≤c≤10000
