农夫约翰在周末进行高能物理实验的时候发生了一些意外，导致他的农场上出现了 N 个虫洞（N 是偶数）。

Some accident made N work holes in the farm field, N is even number

Each worm-hole on different (x, y) in a 2d grid view

For example if A and B paired connect, then A, B can in and out of one of the side.

If A(1,1) and B(3,1) are connected，Betsy start moving x direction starting from (2,1),
she will fall into B and get out of A. Then gets into a dead loop.

John knows the positions of each hole and also knows Betsy can only move horizontally right, but
he doesn't know Betsy's start point. When betsy has a hole in front, she will fall into it.

Now please calculate how many possible ways can make the pair connection that cause the dead loop

Input:
N number of worm hole

N lines of (x, y)

Output:
number of ways to cause dead loop

constraints:
2≤N≤12,
0≤x,y≤10^9

Sample input:
4
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1

Sample output:
2
