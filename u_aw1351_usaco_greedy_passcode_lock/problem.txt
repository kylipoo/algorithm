There are 3 passcode pad, each pad has number 1…N, and the pads are round.

There are two sets of combinations that can open the passcode, one is the passcode John set, the other is from the
manufacture

There are certain fault tolerance. As long as the number on the pad matching with any of the group within 2 digits,
the passcode will work.

For example, if John sets the passcode (1,2,3), the manufacture passcode is (4,5,6)

Then we input (1,3,5), it is unlocked，because (1, 3, 5) is close to (1,2,3)，input (2,4,8) we can also unlock because it
is close to (4,5,6).

But (1, 5, 6) won't open the lock

Now given two preset passcode, please tell how many passcodes can open the lock

The passcode has order, so (1,2,3) and (3,2,1) are two different code

Input:
N
John's passcode
manufacture passcode

Output
total passcode numbers that can open the lock

Constraints:
1≤N≤100

Sample Input:
50
1 2 3
5 6 7

Sample Output:
249
